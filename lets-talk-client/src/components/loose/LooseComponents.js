      JavaScript: This website's logic is 100% JavaScript. It's the good stuff.
      Easy going yet powerful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Haskell: My primary language at work. Haskell can make some seriously fast
      backends.
    </p>
    <p>C++: Competitive Programming duh!</p>
    <p>
      Python: Well, you gotta know python. Can't get more general purpose than
      this.
    </p>
    <p>Java: OOPs. I did it again!</p>
    <p>
      Other than this lovely collection of languages that <b>don't</b> always
      get along, I also dabble in PHP, C, Rust and Bash.

      APIs: Ever since I started coding, I was fascinated by server side
      architecture. I was drawn mostly to REST (express/django) which is what
      70-80% of my current work entails. Win-Win!
    </p>
    <p>
      FrontEnd: Honestly, I'm not the greatest at design but modern JS
      frameworks coupled with the DOM + CSSOM model make web based front end
      development easy even for me ðŸ¤ª
    </p>
    <p>
      Database: Over the course of me being a developer, I've worked with MySQL,
      PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis in ORMs, core libraries, raw queries, etc.
      Needless to say, I know my data.
    </p>
    <p>
      DVCS: Git is magic. Prove me wrong! I have worked with git CLI, github,
      jira/bitbucket and gitlab. Unsolicited opinion: Github is the best!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cloud: I have used Heroku, Digital Ocean for quick and easy CI/CD
      workflows. I got into AWS recently and am loving it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than all of this, some other tools I'm familiar with include
      Postman, Kibana, MongoDB Compass, PGWeb and XAMPP.
